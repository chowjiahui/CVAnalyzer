## ü§î Why Does This Exist?

><em>"Right now, is where the suffering arises. Between the sound and the projection, between things-as-they-are and things as we-want-them-to-be. This is what the Buddha taught: to misperceive reality is to suffer."</em><br>
> Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche, In Love with the World: A Monk's Journey Through the Bardos of Living and Dying
